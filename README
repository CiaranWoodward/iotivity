==                      Rich Stack & Lite Stack                              ==
===============================================================================

The directory "resource" in IOTIVITY repository (referred as "<iotivity>")
contains two SDKs with underlying code (i.e. "stack"). The two SDKs are
referred to as "Rich SDK" (or "C++ SDK") and "Lite SDK" (or "C SDK"). The
associated stacks are referred to as "Rich Stack" (or "C++ Stack") and "Lite
Stack" (or "C Stack"), respectively. The Rich Stack-SDK pair requires that the
Lite Stack-SDK pair is built under it.

===============================================================================

The Rich Stack is intended ONLY for Linux Ubuntu 12.04 operating system. To
build Rich Stack, please follow these requirements:
- GCC compiler version is 4.6
- Pre-install the "gnu-libc" libraries package.

The Lite Stack is intended ONLY for Linux Ubuntu 12.04, Arduino ATMega 2560
with Arduino Framework 1.0.5, and Arduino Due with Arduino Framework 1.5.7.
Tip: Use Cutecom in Ubuntu 12.04 to view logs from Arduino ATMega 2560 and
Arduino Due.

To build Lite Stack, please follow these requirements for Linux Ubuntu 12.04:
- GCC compiler version is 4.6
- Pre-install the "gnu-libc" libraries package.

NOTE: The Arduino patches mentioned below are required to use the Arduino
Ethernet or WiFi shield.  They are not currently included in the IoTivity 
repository.  Please contact the IoTivity support forum for more information.

To build Lite Stack, please follow these requirements for Arduino ATMega 2560:
- Arduino Framework 1.0.5 is installed.
- AVR-GCC compiler version is 4.5.3 (Distributed with Arduino 1.0.5, no further
  action necessary if framework was obtained from
  http://arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases. Note: Frameworks obtained from
  apt-get have had different compiler versions.)
- Unzip the Time Library from here to your Arduino Directory Structure:
  http://playground.arduino.cc/code/time
- Apply patch "arduino-1.0.5_linux.patch" at <iotivity>/tools/arduino/patches
  to your Arduino Directory Structure at location <Arduino 1.0.5>.
- Create/Append "local.properties" file at location <iotivity>/resource/csdk/
  with the following specified:

  ARDUINO_DIR := <arduino-1.0.5>
  ARDUINO_TOOLS_DIR := $(ARDUINO_DIR)/hardware/tools/avr/bin

To build Lite Stack, please follow these requirements for Arduino Due:
- Arduino Framework 1.5.7 is installed.
- AVR-GCC compiler version is 4.8.3 (Distributed with Arduino 1.5.7, no further
  action necessary if framework was obtained from
  http://arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases. Note: Frameworks obtained from
  apt-get have had different compiler versions.)
- Unzip the Time Library from here to your Arduino Directory Structure:
  http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Time.html
- Apply patch "arduino-1.5.7_linux.patch" at <iotivity>/tools/arduino/patches
  to your Arduino Directory Structure at location <Arduino 1.5.7>.
- Create/Append "local.properties" file at location <iotivity>/resource/csdk/
  with the following specified:

  ARDUINO_DIR := <arduino-1.5.7>
  ARDUINO_TOOLS_DIR := $(ARDUINO_DIR)/hardware/tools/avr/bin

Note: If you are building for Arduino Mega and building for Arduino Due you may
find it useful to set the "local.properties" file to look like this:

ifeq ($(PLATFORM), arduinomega)
	#Location of arduino sdk for Arduino Mega
	ARDUINO_DIR := <arduino-1.0.5>
	ARDUINO_TOOLS_DIR := $(ARDUINO_DIR)/hardware/tools/avr/bin
else
	#Location of arduino sdk for Arduino Due
	ARDUINO_DIR := <arduino-1.5.7>
	ARDUINO_TOOLS_DIR := $(ARDUINO_DIR)/hardware/tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4.8.3-2014q1/bin
endif

===============================================================================

Instructions for Common Build Processes:

Please use the following GNU make targets to build for the specific platform(s)
you wish to build. Please review "makefile" at the same directory level as this
README document to find the build output locations.

NOTE: 'GNU Make' is required to utilize the makefile at location:
<iotivity>/makefile.

NOTE: In release "M1" the build process only allows for single platforms to be
built at a time. For instance, you may only build successfully when building
either Lite modules for Arduino ATMega 2560, building Lite modules for Arduino Due,
or building Lite modules and/or Rich modules for Linux. Also, you may only build
either a RELEASE or a DEBUG revision at this time. Later releases will support
building for any and all platforms' modules with a single 'makefile' command.
