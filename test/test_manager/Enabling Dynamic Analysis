Enabling Dynamic Analysis
1. Valgrind is used for conducting dynamic analysis along with API teting 
2. Install Valgrind(3.13.0 version) on the ubuntu machine 
3. To run the API testing along with the Dynamic analysis, we need to pass additional argument '--memcheck=1' 
	Example : 
	If you are running RE API testing in the test manager you would run  
		$ python3 ./test_runner.py -m re -a -o 
	To run the dynamic analysis also in parallel we need to pass the command as   
		$python3 ./test_runner.py -m re -a -o --memcheck=1 
4. The XML results of the run would have been generated under the folder ../MemCheckReport/Result/__run__
5. To get the summary of the XML generated into an excel file we need to run the DynamicResultAnnalyzer.py file,this program shall generate the summary of the current execution and store in the MemCheckReport location, You can also pass module name as the argument to give name to the summary excel file.  
	Example: To generate the Results of RE module   
		$ python3 ./DynamicResultAnnalyzer.py RE
6. Above action would have renamed _run_ folder with RE and appropriate time stamp and would have placed   the consolidated excel in it
7. Consolidated excel shall contain  
	a) Summary sheet which gives basic information about the kind of failure and the test case source of that failure  
	b) Comprehensive sheet which provides a detailed information of the failure
