Team 24
=========================

We developed a soft sensor that reads sensor data values from a smartwatch.
We obtained three sensor values, the GPS, the heart rate, and the acceleration 
using a combination of the smartwatch and android phones. 

We have a linux environment and android bundle environment that both operates
in the same manner. We created the linux environment to allow interactivity
with the smartwatch using bluetooth. 

After obtaining these values, we calculated the activity levels of a person
And we were able to determine how much activity a person is doing,
and whether the activity level is dangerous to the person based on 
how fast he is moving, and his heart rate, and how much his location changes. 

There are three  activity levels
one is NORMAL, when the user is having normal activity levels, nothing special
one is EXERCISING, when the user is doing exercise,
the last is ABNORMAL, when the user is not moving but still having abornal heart rate.
