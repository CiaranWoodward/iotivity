SleepPlaceSensor : A Sensor Telling Where We Should Sleep.

1. Description

SleepPlaceSensor is a soft sensor that finds a good place to sleep.
SleepPlaceSensor combines several kinds of sensing data from physical sensors.

This Sensor use the SleepPlaceIndex determined by the following rule:

1) There are 5 kinds of sensing data
	- humidity, temperature, light-intensity, emc-intensity, sound

2) Each sensor has an ideal value which means good to sleep and max value which
means the dangerous condition.
	- this value is searched in healthcare reference site.

3) Each sensor data is reflected to the score by the following fomula:
	- ((current value - ideal value) / max value * 100) ^ 2
	- We assume that sleep condition is determined by how far from the ideal
	  value.
	- As the value becomes farther from the ideal value, the negative effect
	  on deep sleep gets more serious, so we square the derivation between the
	  current value and the ideal value.
	  
4) Final result (SleepPlaceIndex) is derived from 100 - average of each scores
	- Using this index, we can define the level of how good we can sleep in
	  the place

2. Input sensors

1) LightSensor
	- goal: check the lightness level of the room
	- output: light-intensity

2) Sound Sensor
	- goal: check the soundness of the room
	- output: sound

3) EMC Sensor 
	- goal: check the electromagnetic wave of the current place
	- output: emc-intensity

4) Temparature Sensor
	- goal: check the temparature of the room

5) Humidity sensor
	- goal: check the humidity of the room
