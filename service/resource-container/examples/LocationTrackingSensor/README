Location Tracking Sensor

1. Description

LocationTracking Sensor is a soft sensor for tracking person who needs for being cared.

1-1. This sensor needs
    1) Accelerometer
    3) Magnetic Sensor
    4) WiFi module

1-2. This sensor's output is location of target person.

2. Utilized sensors

We used accelerometer, magnetic sensor, and WiFi module to get the location of the user device. 

1-1. Accelerometer:

- output: 3 dimensional acceleration vector
- The output of the accelerometer satisfies following equation.
    Acceleration = linear acceleration + gravity
- Location of the device is found by integrating linear acceleration twice.
- Gravity component calculated from the accelerometer is used to make a compass.  

2-1. Magnetic sensor:  

- output: 3 dimensional magnetic force vector
- Combining the orientation(especially azimuth) from magnetic sensor and gravity component from
  above accelerometer, we can make a compass to get the information about the global coordinate.

3-1. WiFi module:

- output: RSSI, frequency
- We can get the RSSI(in dBm) and frequency(in MHz) of signal from connected AP(Access Point)
  and calculate the distance from AP.

3. Accuracy Problem

- Our focus was on utilization of IoTivity framework, not on the performance of our soft sensor.
  So the output accuracy of our location sensor is relatively low, although we did some basic
  signal processing to reduce the effect of noise.
