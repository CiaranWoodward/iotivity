	...	|objective	| Verify the Server (DUT) ) respond with a user resource (e.g.,/a/light) information when the Server (DUT)    |
	...	|objective	| has ACL including user resource (e.g., /a/light) with no READ permission on SVR database. |
	...	|target	| Server DUT |
	...	|test_data| /a/light |
	...	|test_configuration| None |
	...	|pre_condition| 1. Server (DUT) has an ACL including "oic/res" with READ permission for all subject(e.g., "*").   |
	...	|pre_condition| 2. Server (DUT) has an ACL including user resource (e.g.,/a/light) with READ permission for Client  on SVR database file that be installed on the Server (DUT).    |
	...	|procedure| 1. DUT is Connected/Discoverable |
	...	|procedure| 2. Use the Test Application to initiate a multicast discovery (GET /oic/res) |	
	...	|procedure| 3. Send  response to GET Req. |
	...	|procedure| 4. Use the Test Application to initiate secure GET request (e.g., GET /a/light) |
	...	|procedure| 5. Send  response to GET Req. |
	...	|post_condition|None |
	...	|expected| Client (TE) get RSP 2.03 or 2.05 |
