	...	|objective	|Verify the Server (DUT) accept an operation mode of provisioning from provisioning tool  |
	...	|target	|Server DUT |
	...	|test_data| “/oic/sec/pstat.om” == “bx0000 0011” |
	...	|test_configuration| 1. Server (DUT) should be an ‘unowned’ state and support device provisioning operation mode bit as bx0000,0011 |
	...	|test_configuration|    (single device has all provisioning services and provisioning service in control of provisioning) |
	...	|test_configuration| 2. Client (TE) should support the client-directed in a single device mode|
	...	|pre_condition| CT1.7.3 is successfully finished.  |
	...	|procedure| 1. Use the Test Application to initiates a PUT request to /oic/sec/pstat resource in the Server (DUT) to select a client-directed in a single device mode |	
	...	|procedure| 2. Server sends response of PUT req. to pstat |
	...	|post_condition|None |
	...	|expected| 1. Client (TE) get RSP 2.04    |
	...	|expected| 2. Server’s (DUT) pstat.Om property is “bx0000 0011”. “/oic/sec/pstat.om” == “bx0000 0011” |
