	...	|see	| Security Spec section 7.4 Provisioning |
	...	|objective	| Verify the Server (DUT) supports the client-directed provisioning mode |
	...	|objective	| and replies a provisioning status to Client (TE). |
	...	|target	|S erver DUT |
	...	|test_data| None |
	...	|test_configuration | 1. Server (DUT) should be an ‘unowned’ state and support the device provisioning operation mode bit |
	...	|test_configuration |    as bx0000,0011 (single device has all provisioning services and provisioning service in control of provisioning) |
	...	|test_configuration | 2. jj)	Client (TE) should support the client -directed provisioning mode. |
	...	|pre_condition| Any one of three method is successfully finished.  |
	...	|pre_condition|    Option 1) Just-Works: CT1.7.2.1 is successfully finished.  |
	...	|pre_condition|    Option 2) Random Pin Based: CT1.7.2.2 is successfully finished. |
	...	|pre_condition|    Option 3) Manufacturer Certificate Based: CT1.7.2.3 is successfully finished. |
	...	|procedure| 1. Client uses the Test Application to initiate a GET request to /oic/sec/pstat resource in the Server (DUT). |	
	...	|procedure| 2. Server Sends response of pstat |
	...	|post_condition|None |
	...	|expected| The response should contain “bx0000 0011” as a supported provisioning mode    |
	...	|expected| in “Sm” property. Server (DUT)’s “/oic/sec/pstat.sm” == “bx0000 0011” |
